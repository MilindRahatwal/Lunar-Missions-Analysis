# Lunar-Missions-Analysis
With the rapid progress in space technology, landing humans on the Moon is now within our reach. In our project, we carefully studied all the lunar missions conducted worldwide. We looked at both successful and unsuccessful missions, using two sets of data. One dataset covered lunar missions from all countries, while the other focused specifically on Chaandrayaan (India's lunar missions). This approach allowed us to explore the broader picture of global lunar exploration and also dive into the details of India's exciting ventures to the Moon. By combining these datasets, we gained a clear and easy-to-understand insight into humanity's journey to the lunar surface, celebrating achievements and learning from challenges.
