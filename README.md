# Lunar-Missions-Analysis
In our project, we carefully studied all the lunar missions conducted worldwide. We looked at both successful and unsuccessful missions, using two sets of data. One dataset covered lunar missions from all countries, while the other focused specifically on Chaandrayaan (India's lunar missions).
